            <remarks>
            <para>The class represents wrapper of an image in unmanaged memory. Using this class
            it is possible as to allocate new image in unmanaged memory, as to just wrap provided
            pointer to unmanaged memory, where an image is stored.</para>
            
            <para>Usage of unmanaged images is mostly beneficial when it is required to apply <b>multiple</b>
            image processing routines to a single image. In such scenario usage of .NET managed images 
            usually leads to worse performance, because each routine needs to lock managed image
            before image processing is done and then unlock it after image processing is done. Without
            these lock/unlock there is no way to get direct access to managed image's data, which means
            there is no way to do fast image processing. So, usage of managed images lead to overhead, which
            is caused by locks/unlock. Unmanaged images are represented internally using unmanaged memory
            buffer. This means that it is not required to do any locks/unlocks in order to get access to image
            data (no overhead).</para>
